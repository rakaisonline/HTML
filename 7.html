                <p class="planet-desc" >Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. 
                    Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. 
                    It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, 
                    and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, 
                    Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet; its apparent distance from the 
                    Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be 
                    seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. 
                    At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe than Venus. 
                    From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, 
                    which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days. Due to its synodic proximity to Earth, 
                    Mercury is most often the closest planet to Earth, with Venus periodically taking this role.
                    Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 
                    3:2 spin–orbit resonance,[20] meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly 
                    three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.[a][21] As seen from the Sun, in a frame of 
                    reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. 
                    An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.
                    
                    Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about 1⁄30 degree). 
                    Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System;[b] at perihelion,
                     Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. 
                     Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating 
                     that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, 
                     it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System, ranging 
                     from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions.
                     The polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F). The planet has no natural satellites.
                    
                    Two spacecraft have visited Mercury: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975; and MESSENGER, launched in 2004, 
                    orbited Mercury over 4,000 times in four years before exhausting its fuel and crashing into the planet's surface 
                     on April 30, 2015.[23][24][25] The BepiColombo spacecraft is planned to arrive at Mercury in 2025. </p>

                 <p class="planet-desc" >Earth is the third planet from the Sun and home to all known life. While large volumes of water can be found 
                    throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. Approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface
                     is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land, 
                     consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, 
                     which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic 
                     field that shapes the magnetosphere of Earth, deflecting destructive solar winds.

                    The atmosphere of Earth consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO2) 
                    trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds 
                    that cover most of the planet. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by
                     atmospheric and ocean circulation. A region's climate is governed not only by latitude but also by elevation and proximity 
                     to moderating oceans. In most areas, severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heat waves, occurs and greatly 
                     impacts life.
                    
                    Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, 
                    it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year 
                    (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. The Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours 
                    and 56 minutes). The Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, 
                    producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400 km (1.28 light seconds) 
                    and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. Through tidal locking, the Moon always faces the Earth with the same side, which causes 
                    tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
                    
                    Earth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas in the early Solar System. During the first 
                    billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and began to affect Earth's 
                    atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have reached 
                    a population of 8 billion today. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly 
                    impacted the planet's environment. Today, humanity's impact on Earth's climate, soils, waters, and ecosystems is unsustainable, 
                    threatening people's lives and causing widespread extinctions of other life.</p>

                    <img class="planet-image" src="/Planets/jupiter-v2.jpg" alt="Jupiter" />
                    <p class="planet-desc" >Jupiter (Latin: Iūpiter or Iuppiter,[14] from Proto-Italic *djous "day, sky" + *patēr "father", thus "sky father" Greek: 
                        Δίας or Ζεύς),[15] also known as Jove (gen. Iovis [ˈjɔwɪs]), is the god of the sky and thunder, and king of the gods in
                        ancient Roman religion and mythology. Jupiter was the chief deity of Roman state religion throughout the Republican and 
                        Imperial eras, until Christianity became the dominant religion of the Empire. In Roman mythology, he negotiates with 
                        Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, to establish principles of Roman religion such as offering, or sacrifice.

                        Jupiter is usually thought to have originated as a sky god. His identifying implement is the thunderbolt and his 
                        primary sacred animal is the eagle,[16] which held precedence over other birds in the taking of auspices[17] and became 
                        one of the most common symbols of the Roman army (see Aquila). The two emblems were often combined to represent the god 
                        in the form of an eagle holding in its claws a thunderbolt, frequently seen on Greek and Roman coins.[18] As the 
                        sky-god, he was a divine witness to oaths, the sacred trust on which justice and good government depend. Many of his 
                        functions were focused on the Capitoline Hill, where the citadel was located. In the Capitoline Triad, he was the 
                        central guardian of the state with Juno and Minerva. His sacred tree was the oak.
                        Statue of Jupiter, Vatican, Rome.
                        
                        The Romans regarded Jupiter as the equivalent of the Greek Zeus,[19] and in Latin literature and Roman art, the myths 
                        and iconography of Zeus are adapted under the name Iuppiter. In the Greek-influenced tradition, Jupiter was the brother
                         of Neptune and Pluto, the Roman equivalents of Poseidon and Hades respectively. Each presided over one of the three 
                         realms of the universe: sky, the waters, and the underworld. The Italic Diespiter was also a sky god who manifested 
                         himself in the daylight, usually identified with Jupiter.[20] Tinia is usually regarded as his Etruscan counterpart.

                        <img class="planet-image" src="/Planets/Mars.jpg" alt="Mars" />

                        <p class="planet-desc">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, only being larger than 
                            Mercury. In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin 
                            atmosphere (less than 1% that of Earth's), and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust, 
                            as well as a core made of iron and nickel. Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes and 
                            polar ice caps. It has two small and irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos.

                            Some of the most notable surface features on Mars include Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known 
                            mountain in the Solar System and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The Borealis 
                            basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers approximately 40% of the planet and may be a large impact feature.[21] Days 
                            and seasons on Mars are comparable to those of Earth, as the planets have a similar rotation period and tilt of the 
                            rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane. Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low 
                            atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth.[22][23] Both of Mars's polar ice 
                            caps appear to be made largely of water.[24][25] In the distant past, Mars was likely wetter, and thus possibly more 
                            suited for life. It is not known whether life has ever existed on Mars.
                            
                            Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft, beginning with Mariner 4 in 1965. NASA's Viking 1 lander 
                            transmitted the first images from the Martian surface in 1976. Two countries have successfully deployed rovers on 
                            Mars, the United States first doing so with Sojourner in 1997 and China with Zhurong in 2021.[26] There are also 
                            planned future missions to Mars, such as a NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return set to happen in 2026, and the Rosalind 
                            Franklin rover mission, which was intended to launch in 2018 but was delayed to 2024 at the earliest, with a more 
                            likely launch date at 2028.
                            
                            Mars can be viewed from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. This appearance, due to the iron 
                            oxide prevalent on its surface, has led to Mars often being called the Red Planet.[27][28] It is among the brightest 
                            objects in Earth's sky, with an apparent magnitude that reaches − 2.94, comparable to that of Jupiter and surpassed 
                            only by Venus, the Moon and the Sun.[16] Historically, Mars has been observed since ancient times, and over the 
                            millennia has been featured in culture and the arts in ways that have reflected humanity's growing knowledge of it.

                            <img class="planet-image" src="/Planets/Neptune.jpg" alt="Neptune" />
                            <p class="planet-desc">Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known planet in the Solar System. It is the 
                                fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant 
                                planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is 
                                denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its 
                                atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet 
                                orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres;
                                2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing 
                                Neptune's trident.[d]

                                Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical 
                                prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard 
                                to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's 
                                death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and 
                                Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846[1] by Johann Galle 
                                within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly 
                                thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th 
                                century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study 
                                with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; 
                                Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune.[17][18] The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope 
                                and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations
                                 from afar.
                                
                                Like the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, 
                                along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but contains a higher proportion of ices such as water,
                                 ammonia and methane. Similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock;[19] both planets 
                                 are normally considered "ice giants" to distinguish them.[20] Along with Rayleigh scattering, traces of methane
                                  in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance.[21] Newest data from the Gemini 
                                  observatory shows the blue color is more saturated than the one present on Uranus due to thinner haze of 
                                  Neptune's more active atmosphere.[22][23]
                                
                                In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active and 
                                visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern 
                                hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. More recently, in 2018, a newer 
                                main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[24] In addition, these weather patterns are 
                                driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 
                                2,100 km/h (580 m/s; 1,300 mph).[25] Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is 
                                one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (−218 °C; −361 °F). 
                                Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C; 9,300 °F).[26][27] Neptune has a faint and 
                                fragmented ring system (labelled "arcs"), which was discovered in 1984, then later confirmed by Voyager 2.

                                <img class="planet-image" src="/Planets/Uranus.jpg" alt="Uranus" />
                                <p class="planet-desc">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is named after Greek sky deity Uranus (Caelus), who in Greek 
                                    mythology is the father of Cronus (Saturn), a grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and great-grandfather of Ares 
                                    (Mars). Uranus has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. 
                                    The planet is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from 
                                    those of the other two giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn (the gas giants). For this reason, scientists often 
                                    distinguish Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants".

                                    As with gas giants, ice giants lack a well-defined solid surface. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's
                                     and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, 
                                     ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.[17] It has the coldest planetary atmosphere 
                                     in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 kelvins (−224 °C; −371 °F). It has a complex, layered 
                                     cloud structure; water is thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer. 
                                     The planet's interior is mainly composed of ices and rock.[16]
                                    
                                    Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. 
                                    The Uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into 
                                    the plane of its solar orbit. Therefore, its north and south poles lie where most other planets have their 
                                    equators.[21] In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, 
                                    without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets.[21] No other spacecraft have yet 
                                    visited the planet.[22] Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as 
                                    Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).

                                    <p class="planet-desc">Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet as it 
                                        is almost as large and has a similar composition. As an interior planet to Earth, Venus (like Mercury) 
                                        appears in Earth's sky never far from the Sun, either as morning star or evening star. Aside from the 
                                        Sun and Moon, Venus is the brightest natural object in Earth's sky, capable of casting visible shadows 
                                        on Earth at dark conditions and being visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.[19][20]

                                        Venus is the second largest terrestrial object of the Solar System. It has a surface gravity slightly 
                                        lower than on Earth and has a weak induced magnetosphere. The atmosphere of Venus consists mainly of 
                                        carbon dioxide, and, at the planet’s surface, is the densest and hottest of the atmospheres of the four 
                                        terrestrial planets. With an atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface of about 92 times the sea 
                                        level pressure of Earth and a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F), the carbon dioxide gas at 
                                        Venus's surface is in the supercritical phase of matter. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly 
                                        reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, making it the planet with the highest albedo in the Solar System. 
                                        It may have had water oceans in the past,[21][22] but after these evaporated the temperature rose under 
                                        a runaway greenhouse effect.[23] The possibility of life on Venus has long been a topic of speculation 
                                        but convincing evidence has yet to be found.
